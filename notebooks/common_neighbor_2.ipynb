Maintaining the distance dependence in the control is especially crucial this time: We know that the connection probability is much higher for neuron pairs close to each other. Consequently, a neuron that is connected to two other neurons, i.e. a common neighbor is likely to be close to both of them. That in turn is only possible if the two other neurons are close to each other as well, especially if there are many common neighbors between them. This means that in any network with a higher connection probability for nearby neurons the connection probability depends on the number of common neighbors.
